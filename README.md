Documenting my journey with the [30DaysOfJavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript) 

Learning how I want to format this repo as I go, pls forgive =)

Notes:
- I didn't use the intro day as a committed file/folder so each day is one lower numerically than the material
- 1 week break from 09/03/22 because of University courseload
